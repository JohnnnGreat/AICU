                  (RCCGNA) began in Detroit in 1991 and now has over 800 churches across the United States and Canada.
                  RCCG is led by Pastor E.A. Adeboye, and its primary mission is twofold: to make heaven and take as
                  many people with us as possible. RCCG founded RCCGNA Seminary in August of 2012 to train true
                  ambassadors for Christ who would help further this mission. The Seminary provided a
                  biblically-centered education through classroom and online teaching with focused instruction on
                  Biblical studies, theology, pastoral leadership, and ministry. Its pedagogy centered around meeting
                  the needs of the local church. The University transitioned from RCCGNA Seminary to RUNA in 2023.
